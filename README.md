# Tech-challenge-MEG

Thank you for this challenge. It was fun, however I need to admit that it would have takes less time if not completed after a long day coding. At the same time I thought getting it done sooner may be better anyway. 

It is functional and fulfils all points.
Knowing that time is an important factor, I have decided to spend the least amount of time on the look.
